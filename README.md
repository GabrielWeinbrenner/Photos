Notes (Please read before grading) Thank you!!!:

If (username: admin, password: admin) or (username: stock, password: stock) did not successfully login, please try delete the dat folder from photos/photos. Rerun it should work.

When adding tags, you must double click the editing area to start edit. After typing up the new key or values, you must hit “Enter” key on your keyboard for it to save.

In order for the data to be saved, you must exit the program with the exit button in the OS(the X on the top right of the program for Windows and top left for Mac). DO NOT try to use hot keys to end the program.  

In order to search for the tags, for exmaple if one photo has tag "location":"school", you would type in the search bar as follows:
location=school

if there is more condition such as location is school and has condition with other tags, you can do the following:
location=school and x=y 

or in other case:
location=school or x=y
```
